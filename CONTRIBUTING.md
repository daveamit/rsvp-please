## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up Your Development Environment

To contribute code, you'll need to set up your local development environment.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* **Rust & Cargo:** Follow the official Rust installation guide. This method works across **Windows, Linux, and macOS**:
    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf [https://sh.rustup.rs](https://sh.rustup.rs) | sh
    ```
    On Windows, you might need to install build tools (like Visual Studio Build Tools). `rustup` will typically guide you through this.

* **Containerization Tool (Docker or Podman):** Used for running the database. Choose one that suits your environment:
    * **Docker:**
        * **Windows & macOS:** Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
        * **Linux:** Follow the specific instructions for your distribution on the [Docker Engine installation page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
    * **Podman:**
        * **Windows & macOS:** Install [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/downloads).
        * **Linux:** Install via your distribution's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install podman` on Debian/Ubuntu, `sudo dnf install podman` on Fedora). More details at [podman.io](https://podman.io/docs/installation).

### Getting Started

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/daveamit/rsvp-please).
2.  **Clone Your Fork:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/daveamit/rsvp-please.git](https://github.com/daveamit/rsvp-please.git)
    cd rsvp-please
    ```
    (Remember to replace `daveamit` with your GitHub username if you're working on a different fork.)

### Building and Running the Project (All Rust)

The entire project is built with Rust.

1.  **Build the Project:**
    ```bash
    cargo build
    ```
2.  **Run Tests:**
    ```bash
    cargo test
    ```
3.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```
    This command will build and execute the main `rsvp please!` binary. Depending on the project, this might start a web server (e.g., on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`), a command-line application, or another service. Check the console output for specific details.

### Database (PostgreSQL with Docker/Podman)

We use PostgreSQL for the database. Using a containerization tool like Docker or Podman is the recommended way to get it running locally.

#### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

This method typically uses a `docker-compose.yml` file to manage the database container.

1.  **Start the Database Container:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d postgres
    ```
    This will start a PostgreSQL container in the background. You might need to wait a moment for it to initialize.

#### Using Podman Compose (Alternative)

If you prefer Podman, you might use `podman-compose` or directly use `podman` commands if `docker-compose.yml` is not explicitly compatible.

1.  **Start the Database Container with Podman Compose:**
    ```bash
    podman-compose up -d postgres # If podman-compose is installed and configured
    ```
2.  **Alternative (Direct Podman Command):**
    If `podman-compose` isn't used, you might manually start a PostgreSQL container:
    ```bash
    podman run -d --name rsvp-postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=user -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -p 5432:5432 postgres:latest
    ```
    (Adjust user/password/port as needed for the project's configuration).

3.  **Database Migrations:** After the database container is running, you'll need to apply migrations to set up the database schema. This typically involves a Rust-native migration tool.
    * *(Example using a hypothetical `sqlx-cli` or `diesel_cli` for Rust-based migrations)*:
        ```bash
        # Assuming sqlx-cli or similar is used for migrations
        cargo install sqlx-cli # if not already installed
        sqlx database setup
        ```
    * *(Alternatively, if your project uses raw SQL files, provide instructions for connecting to the DB and running them).*

## üìè Code Style and Linting

We use automated tools to maintain code consistency:

* **Rust:** We use `rustfmt` for formatting and `clippy` for linting. Please run these before committing:
    ```bash
    cargo fmt
    cargo clippy --fix
    ```
